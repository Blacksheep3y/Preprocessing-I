                <h1>Hi I'm Matthew Castillo,</h1>
                <p>I am a software developer from the northeast located here in the United States of America. I am passionate about developing code that can help bring the world into a brighter and bigger future. My dreams are to build a humanitarian company,
                    one for the people. A company that isn't run by greed but rather motivated by compassion for other living breathing things. I am determined to find passionate individuals with open hearts and minds for their fellow human being and
                    for all living things on this planet. I want to build a peaceful and easier society to live in through the use of software and technology, a society that is able to connect more people together so that the art of compassion and sympathy
                    amongst human beings can be preserved and not forgotten. This is my dream and my goal, without this information the resume I present before you is meaningless. It is my passion for myself and other living things that will determine
                    my employability because the world runs on people not things.</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>In college, I took my first web development course and learned basic html4 that later transitioned to html5, I also learned css3. Since then, I have expanded my web development skills to incorporate a variety of concepts such as javascript,
                    react, less, and many more acquired over the years. As a web developer I am always learning, and by no means do I feel I have mastered anything thus far. But I do believe I have a talent and a nack for web development and because of
                    this, along with my determination to be successful, I have grown in my confidence as a developer and have gained an astounding proficiency.
                </p>

                <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
                <p>My curriculum at the University of Connecticut consisted of many courses that involved the use of the Adobe Creative Cloud library. As a student interested in video game development the concepts of graphic design were a bit foreign to
                    me, but I understood that to be a good designer, whether that'd be in gaming or in web or graphics that design concepts were fundamentally important to making great content. And thus I learned Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and have
                    continued to grow with these technologies by staying consistent with their implementation and learning from different online courses.</p>

        <div class="work-container">

                <h3>The Spot VR Lounge</h3>
                <h4>Title: Social Media & Game Manager</h4>
                <p>This was a very fun job which involved the management of different VR spaces in order to ensure that all technologies were working efficiently and ensure that customers were able to safely experience the world of VR. The mindset of this
                    company was to always look towards the future, and to constantly build towards better experiences for the people.</p>

                <h3>Still Media Group</h3>
                <h4>Title: Digital Media Intern</h4>
                <p>At this company I experienced my first taste of being an employee at a tech company, although I should state that this was a startup company so the culture here was really layed back yet driven and passionate. There wasn't a CEO who was
                    breathing down your spine, yet you felt pressure to deliver an amazing product because of self-driven goals and that is what made this experience for me so amazing because I was able to grow as a developer and enhance my skills to
                    the next level.</p>

                <h3>Freelance Digital Media Designer</h3>
                <h4>Title: Digital Media Designer</h4>
                <p>I have been working as a Freelance Designer (for free) no pun intended, I take on any project I feel I have opportunity to learn and to grow. This is the best way to become a better designer and developer is to just go for things, and
                    so I try to implement this into my practice as much as I can. I realize that money is awesome and everyone wants to be rich but sometimes you just have to get in on the action even if you are sacraficing a paycheck, knowledge is a
                    valuable asset most people take for granted but not me, I am always willing to learn.</p>
